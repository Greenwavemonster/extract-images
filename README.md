# Python Script to extract images from a Dir to a diffrent Dir (Windows)

I had a Directory full of  diffrent folders which contained images, txt-file, and more... I wanted all image copyed out into a diffrent directory but still have them sorted in their own folder.

This script does that. :)

## What you need to do
In order to run the Script you will need to open and edit the Paths since (start Dir, end Dir etc.) are Hardcoded...
